## 📂 Part 3: Categorizing Sales Volume with the SWITCH Function
🧠 Used the SWITCH() function to categorize sales volume as High, Medium, or Low based on numeric thresholds.

🧮 Formula used:

=SWITCH(TRUE, C8>600, "High", C8>=300, "Medium", "Low")
This function evaluates the Sales Volume in each row and assigns a label in the Switch column accordingly.

📋 This replaced complex nested IF statements, offering:

✅ Improved readability

⚙️ Easier logic management

📊 Clear, categorical data segmentation

📸 Screenshot:

✅ Summary of Additional Benefits
The SWITCH function simplified conditional logic that would otherwise require long IF/ELSE formulas.

It allowed for fast categorization across rows and enhanced the dataset for further filtering or chart use.

This technique is highly applicable in dashboards or automated reporting tasks where categorized KPIs are essential.
